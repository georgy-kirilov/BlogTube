                    Uses of Design Patterns
                </h5>
                <p class="article-paragraph-content">
                    Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps
                    to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns. Often, people only understand how to apply certain software design techniques to certain problems.
                    These techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems. Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that doesn't require specifics tied to a particular problem. In addition, patterns allow developers
                    to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.

                    Creational design patterns
                </h5>
                <p class="article-paragraph-content">
                    These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation
                    patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

                    Structural design patterns
                </h5>
                <p class="article-paragraph-content">
                    These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

                    Criticism
                </h5>
                <p class="article-paragraph-content">
                    The study of design patterns has been excessively ad hoc, and some have argued that the concept sorely needs to be put on a more formal footing. At OOPSLA 1999, the Gang of Four were (with their full cooperation) subjected to a show trial, in which they
                    were "charged" with numerous crimes against computer science. They were "convicted" by â…” of the "jurors" who attended the trial.
